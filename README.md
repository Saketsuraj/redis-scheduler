### Redis - Scheduler using Nodejs
Redis - scheduler is used to take some action based on expired keys.

### Features:
1. Listen for expiring events by registering handlers to simple redis keys.
2. Multiple handlers can be set per key.
3. Events can be rescheduled or cancelled with automatic handler cleanup.
4. Can listen for patterns with one or many handlers using regular expressions.

### Steps to setup:
Download repo and open in your editor 
Install node_modules  
run `npm install redis-scheduler 
run `node index.js`
`
